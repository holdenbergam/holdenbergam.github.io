<a href="CV.pdf">[CV]</a> I am a third and final-year undergraduate at Columbia University, majoring in mathematics. I am currently applying for PhD programs in computer science. This website houses some of my publications and teaching materials.




Research
======
I'm interested in theoretical computer science, including foundations of machine learning, geometric data analysis, and algorithms (especially approximation algorithms and algorithms for massive data). I am also quite excited by the interdisciplinary possibilities of mathematical modelling, having done projects in natural language processing and geostatistical modeling. 

Recent research projects include a rigorous analysis of globally optimal t-distributed stochastic neighbor embeddiings (t-SNE) and a new, density-adaptive discretization scheme for altimetry modeling of the Greenland ice sheet.


Teaching
======
There is a daunting amount of knowledge out there. I take inspiration in the idea that people who put in the work of learning can help refine the knowledge base. This drives me to create learning materials, which usually take the form of videos (housed by my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/njbergam">YouTube channel</a>) or expository writing (housed on this website).
