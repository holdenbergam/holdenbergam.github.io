My name is Noah. I am a rising third-year at Columbia studying mathematics and computer science. I plan to graduate this year, so I am currently applying to PhD programs for the fall of 2025. 

Research
======
I am primarily interested in probability theory and its applications in (usually theoretical) computer science. My current research projects are centered on establishing a rigorous analysis of the loss landscape of t-SNE (a popular dimensionality reduction algorithm) and enhancing a b-spline-based regression technique for remote sensing time series data. My past projects have ranged from topological data analysis of poetry to 


Teaching
======
There is a daunting amount of knowledge out there. I take inspiration in the idea that people who put in the work of learning can help refine the knowledge base. This drives me to create learning materials, which usually take the form of videos or expository writing.
