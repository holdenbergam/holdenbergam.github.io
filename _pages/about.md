I am a rising third-year at Columbia studying math and computer science. This website houses some of my publications and teaching materials.

Research
======
I'm interested in theoretical computer science, specifically applications of probability and functional analysis in machine learning. I am also quite excited by the interdisciplinary possibilities of mathematical modelling, having done projects in natural language processing and geostatistical modeling. 

My current research projects include a rigorous analysis of the loss landscape of t-SNE (a popular dimensionality reduction algorithm) and enhancing a b-spline-based regression technique for remote sensing time series data. 


Teaching
======
There is a daunting amount of knowledge out there. I take inspiration in the idea that people who put in the work of learning can help refine the knowledge base. This drives me to create learning materials, which usually take the form of videos (housed by my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/njbergam">YouTube channel</a>) or expository writing (housed on this website).
