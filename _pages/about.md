I am a third-year student at Columbia University, majoring in mathematics. This website houses some of my publications and teaching materials.


Research
======
I'm interested in theoretical computer science, including approximation algorithms, foundations of machine learning, and geometric data analysis. I am also quite excited by the interdisciplinary possibilities of mathematical modelling, having done projects in natural language processing and geostatistical modeling. 

Recent research projects include a rigorous analysis of globally optimal t-distributed stochastic neighbor embeddiings (t-SNE) and a new, density-adaptive discretization scheme for altimetry modeling of the Greenland ice sheet.


Teaching
======
There is a daunting amount of knowledge out there. I take inspiration in the idea that people who put in the work of learning can help refine the knowledge base. This drives me to create learning materials, which usually take the form of videos (housed by my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/njbergam">YouTube channel</a>) or expository writing (housed on this website).
