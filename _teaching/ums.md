I have given a number of lectures to the Undergraduate Math Society, on topics ranging from topological data analysis to combinatorics to spectral graph theory. Here are some lecture notes and slides.


Topological Insights on Vector-Embedded Language
======

Topological data analysis (TDA), in contrast with more traditional statistical methods, allows us to quantify the shape and effectively reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional, nonlinear data. In this project, we use TDA to enhance a simple linear regression model aimed at automated author classification. Motivated by
previous applications of TDA to time series data, we collect topological metrics of the sequence of word embeddings and use these as features. We find that these TDA-driven metrics outdo more direct statistical analyses of the word embeddings such as max or sum pooling. This project sheds light into benefits of incorporating TDA into the natural language processing and general machine learning pipeline.

Coins, Partitions, and Generating Functions

How many ways are there to change a dollar into pennies, nickels, quarters, and dimes? How quickly can we figure it out? These questions and their immediate generalizations take us on a fascinating tour of combinatorics. In this talk, we analyze the change-making problem using generating functions, and we use our method to motivate the theory of counting partitions (where a partition is simply an arrangement of n objects into k distinct piles). In developing this theory, we arrive at powerful results such as Euler's Pentagonal Number Theorem and Hardy and Ramanujan's asymptotic formula for the partition function.

t-SNE's spectral regime
======
<a href="ums3.pdf">[Presentation] </a>
t-SNE (Van der Maaten 2008) is a powerful dimensionality reduction algorithm. In this talk, we introduce the leading theoretical model for understanding t-SNE (and what it might be missing). This model, developed by Cai and Ma (2022), unveils how, under certain conditions, t-SNE approximates a classical dimensionality reduction technique known as spectral clustering.
