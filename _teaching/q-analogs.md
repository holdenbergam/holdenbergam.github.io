I gave a couple of lectures on q-analogs in enumerative combinatorics.

Introduction to q-analogs
======
q-analogs generalize combinatorial objects into functions of a formal variable q (and recover the original concept when we send q to 1). We prove that the q-analog for n! provides us with the generating function for inversions, and we explore basic results regarding the q-binomial coefficient. With time permitting, we discuss where q-analogs come up in the study of symmetric functions


Using q-hypergeometric series to prove Euler's Pentagonal Number Theorem
======
Euler's pentagonal number theorem establishes a beautiful picture of the partition generating function. q-hypergeometric series are a hammer of modern enumerative combinatorics which makes the proof of this theorem quite easy.
